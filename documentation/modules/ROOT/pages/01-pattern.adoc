== The story behind this solution pattern

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. It is being used heavily for production grade applications. Kubernetes clusters are being created and used in public and private clouds. Managing 100s of clusters across multi-cloud and running 1000s of applications on those clusters is cumbersome. Using GitOps(ArgoCD) and RedHat ACM, we can manage multiple kubernetes clusters as well as deployments of applications on those clusters. Majority of the applications need persistent storage. RedHat provides ODF as software defined storage solution which can be deployed across multiple clusters through GitOps.
